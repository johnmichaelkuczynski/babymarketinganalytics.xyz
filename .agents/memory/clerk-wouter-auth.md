# Clerk + wouter auth wiring (qr-course / EthosReason)

A protected-route HOC that wraps page components for `wouter`'s `<Route component={...}>`
must accept `ComponentType<any>` props, NOT a generic constrained to
`Record<string, unknown>`. wouter's `RouteComponentProps` has no string index
signature, so a `Record<string,unknown>`-constrained wrapper fails typecheck
(TS2322) on every parameterized route (`/lectures/:id`, etc.).

**Why:** wouter passes `RouteComponentProps<params>` to the component; that type is
not assignable to `Record<string, unknown>`. Using `any` for the wrapper's props is
the pragmatic fix and still spreads route params through to the wrapped page.

**How to apply:** keep `protectedComponent(Component: ComponentType<any>)` returning
`(props: any) => <Show signed-in><Component {...props}/></Show>` so wouter route
params (`:id`, `:weekNumber`, etc.) survive the auth gate.

Other durable points for this artifact:
- Base path `/` must render a PUBLIC landing for signed-out users (never auto-redirect
  to sign-in); signed-in users redirect to `/dashboard`. The dashboard was moved off
  `/` to `/dashboard` to make room for the public landing.
- API routes are intentionally left ungated (no `requireAuth`) to preserve the
  one-click demo/diagnostics flow. Web auth here is cookie-based — do not add
  Bearer/getToken to the web client.
- Google provider is enabled by default on Replit-managed Clerk; provider management
  is done in the workspace Auth pane, not in code.
- `@clerk/react` v6 uses the signals/future API, NOT the old clerk-react hooks.
  `useSignIn()` returns `{ signIn, errors, fetchStatus }` — there is NO `isLoaded`,
  and `signIn` is a `SignInFutureResource` with NO `authenticateWithRedirect`.
  To start social OAuth from a custom button use
  `signIn.sso({ strategy: "oauth_google", redirectUrl, redirectCallbackUrl })`:
  `redirectCallbackUrl` = the in-app SSO callback handler route
  (`${basePath}/sign-in/sso-callback`, handled by the `<SignIn>` catch-all
  `/sign-in/*?`), and `redirectUrl` = the final post-auth destination
  (`${basePath}/dashboard`). Wrap the call in try/catch so a disabled provider
  surfaces a visible error instead of failing silently.
